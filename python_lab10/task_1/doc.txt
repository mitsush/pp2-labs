psql -f demo.sql -U postgres  - one of the day to create a database by term
CREATE DATABASE __name__; - second way to do that
INSERT INTO name-table [( atribut ... )]
  VALUES ( vallue, ... );

for ex:
CREATE DATABASE aircrafts (
    aircraft_code char( 3 ) NOT NULL,
    model text NOT NULL,
    range integer NOT NULL
    PRIMARY_KEY ( aircraft_code )
);

to add some data
INSERT INTO aircrafts (aircraft_code, model, range)
VALUES ('SU9', 'Sukhoi SuperJet-100', 3000);

to choose 
SELECT name...
  FROM table_name;
for ex:
SELECT * FROM aircrafts; - all data

sort
SELECT model, aircraft_code, range
  FROM aircrafts
  ORDER BY model;

SELECT model, aircraft_code, range
  FROM aircrafts
  WHERE range >= 4000 AND range <= 6000;
